# `replace` Function

-> **Note:** This page is about Terraform 0.12 and later. For Terraform 0.11 and
earlier, see
[0.11 Configuration Language: Interpolation Syntax](../../configuration-0-11/interpolation.html).

`replace` searches a given string for another given substring, and replaces
each occurrence with a given replacement string.

```hcl
replace(string, substring, replacement)
```

If `substring` is wrapped in forward slashes, it is treated as a regular
expression, using the same pattern syntax as
[`regex`](./regex.html). If using a regular expression for the substring
argument, the `replacement` string can incorporate captured strings from
the input by using an `$n` sequence, where `n` is the index or name of a
capture group.

## Examples

```
> replace("1 + 2 + 3", "+", "-")
1 - 2 - 3

> replace("hello world", "/w.*d/", "everybody")
hello everybody
```
