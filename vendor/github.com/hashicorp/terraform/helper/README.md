# Legacy Helper Libraries

The packages in this directory are all legacy code. Some of them are legacy
because they are now maintained in
[the Terraform SDK](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk),
while others are just obsolete codepaths that we intend to migrate away
from over time.

Avoid using functions from packages under `helper/` in new projects.
