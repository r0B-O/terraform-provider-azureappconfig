# Community Providers

Discovering and sharing Terraform providers is now available directly in the Terraform Registry. Please visit [registry.terraform.io](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers) to get started.

-> **Note:** Use the “community” filter on the left to view providers published and maintained by community members.

If you have created a new provider and would like to share it on the Registry, please see our [publishing instructions](https://www.terraform.io/docs/registry/providers/publishing.html) to learn how you can easily share it to other Terraform users.
